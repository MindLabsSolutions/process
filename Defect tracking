1. Bug Discovery
Owner: Any team member (Developer, Tester, Project Manager, or End User)
Activity: Identifying and documenting the bug.
  This phase involves recognizing a problem,
Identification
Who: Any team member or end user who encounters unexpected or incorrect behavior in the software.
What: Spotting a deviation from the intended functionality or performance issues. This could occur during development, testing, or in a production environment.
How: Through manual testing, automated test failures, user reports, or monitoring tools that flag errors or performance degradation.

  2. Issue Creation
Owner: Discoverer (the person who identified the bug)
Activity: Opening a new issue and providing detailed information using a bug report template.
Documentation
  Once identified, the bug needs to be thoroughly documented. This documentation serves as the primary reference for the team tasked with resolving the issue. Effective documentation includes:

  1. Descriptive Title:
Provide a concise yet descriptive title that summarizes the bug, enabling quick understanding and sorting. Example: "Crash when attempting to save project on macOS Catalina."
  
  2. Detailed Description:
  Overview: A summary of the bug, including what was expected versus what actually occurred.
  Steps to Reproduce: A step-by-step guide on how to replicate the issue, which is critical for anyone trying to fix it.
  Frequency: Mention how often the bug occurs (always, sometimes, under specific conditions).
  Severity: Assess the impact of the bug on the application's functionality or the user experience.    
  
    3. Environment Details:
Include specific details about the environment where the bug was discovered, such as the operating system, device type, browser and version, application version, network conditions, and any relevant configurations.
  
  4. Evidence:
Screenshots/Videos: Attach visual proof where applicable to illustrate the issue.
Logs: Include any relevant log output or error messages that could help diagnose the problem.
Code Snippets: If applicable, reference the parts of the codebase that might be related to the bug.
  
  5. Additional Information:
Related Issues: Link to any related issues or tickets, if known.
Workarounds: If available, describe any temporary fixes or workarounds to mitigate the impact of the bug.

  Reporting
Where: The detailed report is created in the project's GitHub repository under the "Issues" section. Utilize available templates to ensure consistency and completeness.
Assignment: While the reporter might not assign the bug directly, they should tag or mention the project manager or team lead to ensure the issue is seen and prioritized.
Tools and Best Practices
Use Markdown: For better readability, use GitHub's Markdown syntax to format the issue. Include bullet points, code blocks, and headers where appropriate.
Be Clear and Concise: While detail is good, ensure the report is to the point, avoiding unnecessary information that could distract from understanding and resolving the issue.
The goal of this activity is to provide a clear, detailed, and actionable bug report that can guide the resolution process efficiently. A well-documented bug is easier to prioritize, assign, and ultimately resolve, contributing to the overall quality of the project.



  3. Classification
Owner: Project Manager or Lead Developer
Activity: Applying labels for categorization and assigning the issue to the appropriate team member(s) for resolution.
  Purpose: Labels provide a visual cue about the bug's nature, priority, and status, facilitating quick sorting and filtering.

Steps:
Review Existing Labels: Understand the predefined labels in your GitHub repository. Common labels include types (bug, enhancement), priorities (high, medium, low), status (in progress, blocked), and modules (UI, backend, API).

Select Appropriate Labels: Choose labels that accurately describe the issue's type, priority, and relevant area of the project. You can apply multiple labels to a single issue.

Custom Labels: If existing labels don't cover the bug's specifics, create new labels to better categorize issues. Ensure consistency in label naming and color coding across the project.

Apply Labels: Click on the "Labels" section on the right side of the issue page and select the relevant labels from the dropdown list. If you're creating a new label, you can do so by clicking on "New label".



  4. Prioritization
Owner: Project Manager or Team Lead
Activity: Assessing the bug's impact and urgency, and assigning it to a milestone.

  5. Investigation and Fix Development
Owner: Assigned Developer
Activity: Investigating the cause, developing a fix, and conducting unit tests.

  6. Code Review and Merge
Owner: Reviewer (a peer developer or lead developer) and Assigned Developer
Activity: Reviewing the pull request for the fix, discussing potential improvements, and merging the fix into the main codebase.

  7. Verification and Closure
Owner: QA Tester or the original bug reporter
Activity: Verifying the fix in the main branch or staging environment and closing the issue if resolved.

  8. Reflection and Prevention
Owner: Entire Team (Developers, Testers, Project Managers)
Activity: Analyzing bug trends, reviewing the bug tracking and resolution process, and updating practices to prevent future issues.

  9. Communication
Owner: Project Manager or Communications Lead
Activity: Keeping the team and stakeholders informed about bug status and including bug fixes in release notes.
Additional Tips
Automation

Owner: DevOps or Tooling Specialist
Activity: Implementing GitHub Actions for automatic issue labeling and assignment based on predefined rules.
Documentation

Owner: Project Manager or Documentation Specialist
Activity: Maintaining up-to-date documentation for the bug tracking and resolution process to ensure team alignment.
